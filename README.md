## What is Playlify? ##
Playlify is a tool to help you create playlists automatically on `Spotify`. Playlify accesses songs in your spotify 
library and applies the filters you provide it, to create a playlist accordingly.

## How to use Playlify? ##
There are a variety of filters to help you create the perfect playlist. All of the filters are optional and if no filters are provided, all songs will be added. Filters can also be combined, in which case playlify will only suggest songs that match all the provided filters.

**1) By Genre** <br />
Select a genre and playlify will automatically make a playlist with all your songs that match that genre. Genres are organized by group to help you select all the genres of a group quickly. An example of such a group is the genre group `Rock` which encompasses all different types of Rock genres.

**2) By Artists** <br />
Select one or more artists, and playlify will only suggest songs that were created by one of the provided artists.

**3) By Date Created** <br />
Select a `Created After` date and a `Created Before` date to apply a filter on the release date of songs. Playlify will only suggest songs that were released within the range provided.

## A Practical Example ##
Let's say that we're looking to make a playlist that contains rock songs created in the 1980s. We could then name this playlist `80s Rock`, select the `Rock` genre group to have all different types of rock or we can select specific rock sub-genres. We would then set the `Created After` date to `December 1979` and set the `Created Before` date to `January 1991`. Playlify will then provide us with a list of suggested songs, which we can go over to ensure that the songs match what we wanted.
